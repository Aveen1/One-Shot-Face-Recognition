# One-Shot-Face-Recognition

Takes pictures from webcam each 5 sec or you can adjust the time to miliseconds,
keeps it in a folder and compare that with the pre defined image given through database or any application.
Compare and tell if the person is same or not using Siamese Neural Network and embeddings.
If distance is above threshold it means they are different persons but if distance is less than threshold 
it means they are the same persons.
Threshold should be equal to 1 but here I've used 0.8
